What is it about the assignment you don't understand? 

How have you tried to solve this _prior_ to submitting a request? You might try looking at any notes you have from class, or asking a classmate. Also remember that there may be assignment details in Canvas, in the assignment on repl.it, in a the README.md file of any provided example or starter code, or even in the comments of the code itself.
