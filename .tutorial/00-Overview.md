The Goal
--------

Our objective here is to produce a visualization that combines data from different sources to help tell our story. Here, we continue our exploration of the impacts of redlining. We saw already how the HOLC grades impact current population distributions in the graded areas. Today we want to answer the question of whether or not the HOLC grades have an impact on housing values. 

## Summary of Previous Lab

In the previous lab, we worked with tabular data. We learned how to load a CSV file into a p5 program as a table, how to iterate through the rows of that table, how to extract data from particular columns in a row, or from an entire column, how to aggregate data, and then how to visualize the information.

## Overview of Current Lab

In this lab, we will talk about how to use a different sort of file (JSON), how to effectively combine two data sources, and how to create our own files.
